# History

.left[
- 2017 field tagging trials (tagged few fish, Government Bay)
- 2018 preliminary project (28 receivers, 25 V9 tags)
- 2019-2021 full project (200 tags, 120 receivers)
- 2020 winter- tagging under ice (gill nets)
]

# Capture
.left[
- Nighttime electrofishing
  - Peak spawn- November 10-15
  - ~ 84% survival (6 months)
  - Tagged during peak spawn ~ 10-15' water 
  - Fish not available before/after spawning (too deep!)
]

# Capture
.left[
- Gill net 
  - Difficult or no recovery
  - Tried under ice gill nets, 20 minute soak, ~ 8% survival (6 months)
  - Lots of "rope burns"

# Post-capture care
.left[
- Goal: minimize handling time
- Capture 1-10 fish, transfer fish to waiting "transport boat" and
    Moved to shore
- Hold fish in flow-through .red[ROUND] tank (4') with .red[FLOW]
- Surgery immediately after fish "recovered" from electrofishing
]

# Surgery
.left[
- Tent, propane heater to prevent ice formation on fish and us!
- V9 tags, fish ~ 400 mm TL
- TENS electro mobilization
- <2 min surgery, 2 interrupted sutures
- Constant water flow over gills
]

# Recovery

.left[
- fish released as soon as swimming on own and able to maintain
orientation
- dedicated nurse- gently "assist" fish when upside down
  - upside down cisco needs immediate care to prevent death!
- cisco are finicky- some fish appeared dead in recovery but swam off
after release.

# Tanks and flow

.left[
- Round tanks with sufficient flow flow is critical
  - Rectangular/oval/cattle troughs result in "stuck fish"
- How much flow?
  - Fish should be swimming against current away from side ("endless
    pool")
  - Not enough water flow- fish turn over upside-down, die
  - Too much water flow- fish scrape tank sides
  - We used submersable utility pumps, short hoses and clamps to regulate
]

# Take-home ideas

.left[
- Minimize handling, time in tanks
- Round tanks are critical
- Water flow
- TENs for electro immobilization- quick recovery
- release immediately after fish has regained ability to swim
