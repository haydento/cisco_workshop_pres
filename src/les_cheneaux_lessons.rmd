# History

.left[
- 2017 field tagging trials (Government Bay)
- 2018 preliminary project (28 receivers, 25 V9 tags)
- 2019-2021 full project (200 tags, 120 receivers)
- 2020 winter- capture fish under ice (gill nets)
]

# Capture
.left[
- Electrofishing (night)
  - Peak spawn- approximately November 15
  - <4 m water depth during spawn
  - not available before/after spawning (fish are deep!)
  - ~ 84% survival (6 months)
]

# Capture
.left[
- Gill net 
  - Very effective during fall- USFWS
  - Difficult or no recovery, rope burns, lost scales
  - Tried under ice gill nets, ~20 min soak, ~ 8% survival (6 months)
]

# Post-capture care
.left[
- Minimize handling time
- Capture <10 fish, transfer fish to waiting "transport boat", tagged
on shore
- Hold fish in flow-through .red[ROUND] tank (> 1 m) with .red[FLOW]
- Surgery immediately after fish "recover" from electrofishing
]

# Surgery
.left[
- Tent, heater to prevent ice formation on fish and us!
- V9 tags, fish ~ 400 mm TL, water temp 4-5 C
- Record TL, no external tag
- TENS electro-immobilisation
- <2 min surgery, 2 sutures
- Constant water flow over gills
- < 1 hour from capture to releases

# Recovery

.left[
- Fish released when able to maintain orientation
- Dedicated nurse- gently "assist" fish when upside down
  - Upside down cisco needs care to prevent death!

# Tanks and flow

.left[
- Round tanks critical, flow through
  - Rectangular/oval/cattle troughs result in "stuck fish"
- How much flow?
  - Fish should be swimming against current away from side ("endless
    pool")
  - Insufficient flow- fish turn upside down
  - Excessive flow- fish scrape tank sides
  - We used submersable utility pumps, short hoses, clamps to regulate

# Take-home ideas

.left[
- Minimize handling, time in tanks
- Round tanks are critical
- Sufficient water flow in tanks to promote swimming, flow-through 
- TENS electro-immobilisation- quick recovery
